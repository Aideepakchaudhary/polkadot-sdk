title: "Bounties Pallet: add `approve_bounty_with_curator` call"

doc:
  - audience: [Runtime Dev, Runtime User]
    description: |
      Adds `approve_bounty_with_curator` call to the bounties pallet to combine `approve_bounty` and `propose_curator` into one call. If `unassign_curator` is called after `approve_bounty_with_curator` the process falls back to the previous flow of calling `propose_curator` separately.
